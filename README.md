SwimTracker

SwimTracker is a full-stack swim logging application that helps swimmers track their practice sessions and competitive results. It allows users to log the number of laps swam, stroke type, duration, and view statistics such as total miles swam and laps per stroke. Users can also track competitive events including time, distance, and meet details.

The inspiration behind is app is that I am a swimmer myself, and I have a friend who swims everyday and she manually logs her laps in a Google Sheet. She will manually convert the laps swam into miles, and she loves updating us on how many miles she has swam within the year.

I thought it would be a funny homage to a running joke within one of my friend groups, and for more serious minded people a way for them to track their progress over time
